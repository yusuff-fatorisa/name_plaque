# Name Plaque Application

This simple application calculates the cost of a name plaque. The customers are charged based on the length of letters.

Customers would be able to add letters to a plaque; each letter costs $5. Then, when users enter a new letter, we will show them how much it will cost.

## Breaking it down (series of tasks that have to be performed to achieve the goals)

1. The script is triggered when there is new input.
2. Create a function that counts the number of letters and multiplies the length with $5
3. Create a function that updates the page with the total price
4. Show how much the plaque costs.
